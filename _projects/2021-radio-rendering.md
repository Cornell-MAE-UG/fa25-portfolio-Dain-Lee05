For MAE 3230: Fluid Mechanics class, we were assigned a coffee machine to dissect and analyze fluid systems in the machine. I mostly contributed to the team by leading the dissection with precision and careufulness. After my team had identified out system clearly, I pointed out the pathway of  water pipes that lead up to the needle and pod, where the water is extinguished to extract the coffee out. Lastly, I provided the general structure and a premise of a coffee machine to rest of team as an only person who actually used the coffee machine daily.
